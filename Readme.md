# Extensor Coding

## Switch implementations

There are different implementations for the ExTensor and the Matrix structure. You switch 
between them by simple editing the `Cargo.toml` file.
Just edit the `[features]` default value. If you for example want to use the bitvec implementation
of the extensor and the sparse hash implementation of the matrix use

```
[features]
default = ["extensor_bitvec", "matrix_sparse_hash"]
```

Options are: 
* ExTensor:
    * `extensor_bitvec` - Basis as bitvector
    * `dense_hashmap` - Basis as HashMap
* Matrix
    * `naive` - as 1-D vec
    * `sparse_hash` - as sparse HashMap
    * `sparse_triples` - as sparse vec of triples (row, col, value)

## Run Tests

To run the tests simply do a 
```
cargo test
```
If you only want to run tests in a certain module e.g. all tests in the graph module do
```
cargo test -- graph::tests
```

## Run Benchmarks 

All Benchmarks are located under the `benches/` directory. You can execute them with
```
cargo bench
```

## Create Docs 

Comments can be turned into a documentation with
```
cargo doc --open --no-deps
```
